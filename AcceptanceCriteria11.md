**User Story**

As a contestant<br />
I want the system to provide sample AI players<br />
so that I can explore their source code or run them against my AI players<br />

**Scenario 1**

  1. Download the backgammonatorLibrary.jar from [here](http://code.google.com/p/backgammonator/downloads/list) or download the latest version from the Backgammonator web site. If you have checked out the Backgammonator project then you can simply call the "distLib" target of the build.xml provided.
  1. The backgammonlibrary.jar contains entry "sample" which contains:
    * sources of sample implementations of the Player interface
    * C/C++ sources which implement the Backgammonator protocol
    * Java sources which implement the Backgammonator protocol
