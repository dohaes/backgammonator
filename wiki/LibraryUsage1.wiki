#summary A manual on how to use the backgammonlibrary.jar.

The *backgammonlibrary.jar* is purposed to be used in a standard Java projects as part of the class path. Users which wish to use the Backgammonator Library in this case should follow the steps below:

  # Download the backgammonSysLib.jar from [http://code.google.com/p/backgammonator/downloads/list here]
  # Make a new general Java project in your IDE
  # Place the backgammonlibrary.jar on the project's class path.
  # Create a new class which implements interface backgammonator.lib.game.Player. The backgammonlibrary.jar contains sample implementations of the Player interface which can be explored.
  # Create a new game using the backgammonator.impl.game.GameManager.gewGame() with instances of your implementation of the Player interface. The boolean parameter shows if a game log will be crated using the deafult HTML logger. If the value is true, HTML file containing the result of the game will appear in your project's base directory.
  # Invoke Game.start() method on the object returned by newGame(...) to start the game.
  # After the game is over you can view the resutls as described above.
  # You can run a single game between the same players multiple times. If the game between the players is still not over and Game.start() is invoked an IllegalStateException will be thrown.
