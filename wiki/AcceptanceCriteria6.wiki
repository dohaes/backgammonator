#summary Acceptance criteria scenarios on User Story 6

*User Story*

As a contest manager<br/>
I want the system to provide systematized tournament log<br/>
so that I can view the results from the tournament and analyze them.<br/>

Generation of tournament logs is optional. Each game log should provide the following information:
  * list of the players
  * information about the played game 

For each game the following info is logged:
  * players in the game
  * end status of the game
  
*Scenario*

  # Start a new tournament and wait until it ends.
  # In directory "reports" there should be a tournament log created.
  # In the log there are two tables - with all players in the tournament and with all games played
  # When the user chooses to View link in the Details column for a game, he should see a detailed information for that game in separated page in separated window.
