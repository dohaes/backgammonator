#summary Acceptance criteria scenarios on User Story 5

*User Story*

As a contestant manager<br/>
I want the system to provide an systematized game log<br/>
so that I can view the results for each game.<br/>

Generation of game logs is optional. Each game log should provide the following information:
  * list of the players moves
  * information about the end of the game 

For each move the following info is logged:
  * number of the move
  * color of the player
  * numbers on the dice
  * moved checkers - positions and length of the move
  * hits and born offs for the move
  
*Scenario 1*

  # Start a new game.
  # In directory "reports" there should be a game log created
