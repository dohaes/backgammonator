#summary Acceptance criteria scenarios on User Story 9

*User Story*

As a contestant<br/>
I want to upload the source code of my program via a web interface<br/>
so that I can take part in the tournament<br/>

The web interface should have:
 * filed for file upload
 * radio buttons to select the programming language : Java or C/C++
 * checkbox to select weather the uploaded source to be processed and validated.
 * submit button to upload the file

As convension files which contain Java source code must have .java extensions and files with C/C++ code must have .c extensions.
The submit button should be inactive while the sources are being processed.

*Scenario 1*

  # Nvigate to the source upload page
  # Select a file which extension is .java, nor .c
  # Check Java or C/C++ programming language.
  # Leave the validate ckechbox unchecked.
  # Upload the file.
  # Error massage for invalid file name should be displayed and you will be redirected to the source upload page.

*Scenario 2*

  # Nvigate to the source upload page
  # Select a file which extension is .java
  # Check C/C++ programming language.
  # Leave the validate ckechbox unchecked.
  # Upload the file.
  # Error massage for invalid file name should be displayed and you will be redirected to the source upload page.

*Scenario 3*

  # Nvigate to the source upload page
  # Select a file which extension is .java which has some compilation error in it.
  # Check Java programming language.
  # Check the validate ckechbox.
  # Upload the file.
  # The submit button should be inactive while the system processes the source.
  # Error massage for compilation error should be displayed and you will be redirected to the source upload page.

*Scenario 4*

  # Nvigate to the source upload page
  # Leave the field for the file empty.
  # Check Java or C/C++ programming language.
  # Leave the validate ckechbox unchecked.
  # Press "Upload".
  # Error massage for invalid file name should be displayed and you will be redirected to the source upload page.

*Scenario 5*

  # Nvigate to the source upload page
  # Select a file which extension is .java which implements the protocol properly.
  # Check Java programming language.
  # Check the validate ckechbox.
  # Upload the file.
  # The submit button should be inactive while the system processes the source.
  # Message for successfull upload and validation should be displayed and you will be redirected to the source upload page.

*Scenario 6*

  # Nvigate to the source upload page
  # Select a file which extension is .java which implements the protocol incorrectly.
  # Check Java programming language.
  # Check the validate ckechbox.
